SendGrid now charges taxes in 7 jurisdictions: Denver, Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, Chicago, Illinois, Washington state, New York state, Texas, and Massachusetts. We assign tax jurisdiction by the billing address you have in our system. If your billing address is in one of these jurisdictions, and you don't have 501(3)(c) tax-exempt status, you will see a line for taxes [on your invoice]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/reading_your_invoice.html). For more information about declaring your tax-exempt status, see [Declaring tax-exempt status](#-Declaring-tax-exempt-status).
