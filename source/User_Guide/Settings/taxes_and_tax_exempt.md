SendGrid now charges taxes in 7 jurisdictions: Denver, Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, Chicago, Illinois, Washington state, New York state, and Texas. We assign tax jurisdiction by the billing address you have in our system. If your billing address is in one of these jurisdictions, and you don't have 501(3)(c) tax-exempt status, you will see a line for taxes [on your invoice]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/reading_your_invoice.html). For more information about declaring your tax-exempt status, see [Declaring tax-exempt status](#-Declaring-tax-exempt-status).

Tax FAQ
{% endanchor %}

{% anchor h3 %}
Why does SendGrid charge taxes?
{% endanchor %}

If SendGrid has a physical presence in a jurisdiction, and we directly sell our product to someone located in that jurisdiction, then we are required to collect sales tax on behalf of that jurisdiction.

{% anchor h3 %}
Who is required to pay SendGrid taxes?
{% endanchor %}

SendGrid collects taxes in the following jurisdictions:

- Denver, Colorado
- Boulder, Colorado
- Chicago, Illinois
- Washington state
- New York state

To determine whether to add taxes to your monthly SendGrid bill, we use the address you enter as your billing address in [Settings | Plan & Billing Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) in the SendGrid UI.

{% anchor h3 %}
Where can I see how much I am getting charged for taxes each month?
{% endanchor %}

If you are being charged taxes, you will see it as a line item on your invoice. You can see your invoice in the monthly email, and on the [Plan & Billing details page](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) in the UI.

{% anchor h3 %}
Can I get an estimate of my taxes?
{% endanchor %}

Unfortunately, we cannot provide estimates of taxes for an individual customer ahead of time. The taxes assessed could change monthly for various reasons such as state or local tax laws changing. You can check your bill throughout the month for an estimate of your taxes.

{% anchor h3 %}
Will my tax amount vary from month to month?
{% endanchor %}

Taxes charged can vary month to month based on local tax laws changing, or if your bill is greater or less than in previous months.

{% anchor h3 %}
How does SendGrid know how to charge me in taxes?
{% endanchor %}

Tax laws change regularly, so we work with a third party software that focuses on deeply understanding local and state tax laws. SendGrid uses this software to calculate the taxes you are charged each month.

{% anchor h3 %}
What if I am a reseller?
{% endanchor %}

Resellers are responsible for collecting and verifying their own taxes and taxes for their customers. To declare your status as a SendGrid reseller, email your state reseller certificate to billing@sendgrid.com.

{% anchor h3 %}
What if I am tax-exempt?
{% endanchor %}
