    The design editor is where you build your templates and campaigns using drag & drop and WYSIWYG tools. To get started with the design editor, simply navigate to <strong>Marketing Campaigns</strong> from the left hand navigation menu and select either <strong>Campaigns</strong> or <strong>Templates</strong>. Whenever you open one of your campaigns or templates you will be taken to the design editor.

  <p>
    You can use the design editor to make changes to the various modules like text, images, buttons, links, and custom code that make up the content you include in your campaigns.

The design editor provides the ability to toggle between our drag & drop editor making it easy to click and drag various pre-built modules into your campaign and a **general WYSIWYG editor** providing basic editing and formatting tools.

The design editor can be reached either by creating or editing a template from the [Templates page](https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/ui/marketing_templates), or by creating or editing a campaign from the [Campaigns page](https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/ui/campaigns).

Upon first opening the design editor, you will see a toggle allowing you to switch between the design and code editing experiences. Switching to the code editor will allow you to import, edit, and preview your campaign's raw HTML.
