What is the new campaign and template editing experience?
{% endanchor %}

With SendGrid Marketing Campaign’s new editing experience you now have complete control over your editing environment: you can choose between an optimized visual design editor and a pure HTML code editor.

The **code editor** provides users who are importing, editing, or crafting custom HTML a robust environment to upload images, write HTML, and configure their campaign without interference from HTML generating WYSIWYG tools.

The **design editor** offers users powerful drag & drop WYSIWYG editing tools making it possible for anyone to build beautiful emails, regardless of HTML knowledge. For those familiar with HTML looking to leverage the design editor you can modify the HTML of individual content modules.

Creating New Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

There are two ways to create a new campaign using the beta editor: create a net-new campaign or duplicate an existing campaign.

Following is an explanation of how to create a campaign, and which editor will be available to you.

{% anchor h3 %}
Create a net-new campaign
{% endanchor %}

To create a new campaign, navigate to **Marketing Campaigns** in the left hand navigation menu and click **Campaigns**. Click **Create Campaign** in the upper right corner.

{% anchor h4 %}
Select a template
{% endanchor %}

Next, you will select the template that you would like to use for your campaign. You can either select **Blank Template**, a custom template that you have already created, or one of SendGrid's pre-built templates.

{% anchor h4 %}
Select an editor
{% endanchor %}

Next, you can choose between the **design editor** and the **code editor**.

{% anchor h3 %}
Duplicate a campaign
{% endanchor %}

You can also create a duplicate of a campaign that you would like to reuse. Navigate to the Campaigns page and find the campaign that you want to duplicate. Click the **action cog** and select **Duplicate**.

{% anchor h4 %}
Duplicating a campaign built in the old editor
{% endanchor %}

If the campaign you are duplicating has the label **Old Editor**, then it will  automatically be opened in the _old campaign editor_. You will see a banner at the top of the editor explaining that you are using the old campaign editor. To move your campaign to the beta editor click **Switch to Beta Editor**. After clicking the beta link, you will have the option of opening your campaign in either the design editor or the code editor.

{% info %}
During the beta, you will always be able to open your original campaign in the old editor.
{% endinfo %}

{% anchor h4 %}
Duplicating a campaign built in the beta editor
{% endanchor %}

If the campaign you are duplicating has either the label _Code Editor_ or _Design Editor_, then your duplicate will be opened in the indicated editor.

{% anchor h2 %}
Creating new templates
{% endanchor %}

There are several ways to create a new Marketing Campaigns template. Depending on how you create your template, you may be presented with a choice of editor experiences or you may be channeled into the optimal editor for your template.

Following is an explanation of how you can create a template, and which editor is available for each option.

{% anchor h3 %}
Create a new template
{% endanchor %}

To create a new template, navigate to **Marketing Campaigns** in the left hand navigation menu and select **Templates**. Click **Create New Template**.

{% anchor h4 %}
Select an editor
{% endanchor %}

When creating a brand new template, you may choose between either the design editor or the code editor.

{% anchor h3 %}
Duplicate a SendGrid template
{% endanchor %}

You can easily duplicate a pre-built template provided by SendGrid. Navigate to the **Marketing Templates** page and click **SendGrid Templates** under "Filter By".

Choose your template, click the action cog, and select **Duplicate**. Your duplicate will be automatically opened in the new design editor.

{% anchor h3 %}
Duplicate a custom template
{% endanchor %}

If you would like to duplicate one of your custom templates, simply navigate to the **Marketing Templates** page, find your custom template, click the action cog and select Duplicate.

If the template you are duplicating has the label **Old Editor**, then it will automatically be opened in the _old editor_. However, you will see a banner explaining that you are using the old editor. Click the link in this banner to move your template to the beta editor.

After clicking the beta link, you will have the option of opening your template in either the beta design editor or the beta code editor.

If the template has either the label **Code Editor** or **Design Editor**, your duplicate will be opened in the corresponding editor.

{% anchor h3 %}
Create a template from a campaign
{% endanchor %}

To create a new template from an existing campaign, navigate to the **Campaigns page**. Find the campaign you would like to use, click the action cog, and select **Create Template**. Campaigns labeled **Old Editor** will allow you to choose between opening the template in the code or design editors.

Campaigns labeled **Code Editor** or **Design Editor** will open the template in the corresponding editor.

{% anchor h2 %}
Editing Existing Campaigns or Templates
{% endanchor %}

{% anchor h3 %}
Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

To edit an existing campaign, navigate to the **Campaigns** page and find the campaign that you want to edit. Click the campaign title, or click the **Action Cog** and select **Edit**.

Note: you can only edit campaigns that are in "draft" status. Scheduled or sent campaigns cannot be edited. [To edit a scheduled campaign, simply unschedule it to return to draft status.]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Marketing_Campaigns/marketing_campaigns_faqs.html#-How-do-I-edit-a-scheduled-campaign)

If the existing campaign you selected includes the label **old campaign**, it will automatically be opened in the old campaign editor. You will see a banner explaining that you are using the old editor. To move your campaign to the beta editor, click **Switch to Beta Editor**.

If you switch to the beta editor, SendGrid will create a duplicate of this campaign and will open the duplicate in the beta editor.

You will still be able to return to the old editor by opening your original campaign in the old editor—it should have the label **Old Editor**—but you will be unable to revert the duplicate.

{% anchor h2 %}
Design Editor
{% endanchor %}

The design editor is where you build your templates and campaigns using drag & drop WYSIWYG tools. You can use the design editor to make changes to the various modules like text, images, buttons, links, columns, or custom code that make up the content you include in your campaigns.

{% anchor h3 %}
