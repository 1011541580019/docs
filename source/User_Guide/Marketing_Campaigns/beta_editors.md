What is the new campaign and template editing experience?
{% endanchor %}

With SendGrid Marketing Campaign’s new editing experience you now have complete control over your editing environment: you can choose between an optimized visual design editor and a pure HTML code editor.

The **code editor** provides users who are importing, editing, or crafting custom HTML a robust environment to upload images, write HTML, and configure their campaign without interference from HTML generating WYSIWYG tools.

The **design editor** offers users powerful drag & drop WYSIWYG editing tools making it possible for anyone to build beautiful emails, regardless of HTML knowledge. For those familiar with HTML looking to leverage the design editor you can modify the HTML of individual content modules.

Creating New Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

There are two ways to create a new campaign using the beta editor: create a net-new campaign or duplicate an existing campaign.

Following is an explanation of how to create a campaign, and which editor will be available to you.

{% anchor h3 %}
Create a net-new campaign
{% endanchor %}

To create a new campaign, navigate to **Marketing Campaigns** in the left hand navigation menu and click **Campaigns**. Click **Create Campaign** in the upper right corner.

{% anchor h4 %}
Select a template
{% endanchor %}

Next, you will select the template that you would like to use for your campaign. You can either select **Blank Template**, a custom template that you have already created, or one of SendGrid's pre-built templates.

{% anchor h4 %}
Select an editor
{% endanchor %}

Next, you can choose between the **design editor** and the **code editor**.

{% anchor h3 %}
Duplicate a campaign
{% endanchor %}

You can also create a duplicate of a campaign that you would like to reuse. Navigate to the Campaigns page and find the campaign that you want to duplicate. Click the **action cog** and select **Duplicate**.

{% anchor h4 %}
Duplicating a campaign built in the old editor
{% endanchor %}

If the campaign you are duplicating has the label **Old Editor**, then it will  automatically be opened in the _old campaign editor_. You will see a banner at the top of the editor explaining that you are using the old campaign editor. To move your campaign to the beta editor click **Switch to Beta Editor**. After clicking the beta link, you will have the option of opening your campaign in either the design editor or the code editor.

{% info %}
During the beta, you will always be able to open your original campaign in the old editor.
{% endinfo %}

{% anchor h4 %}
Duplicating a campaign built in the beta editor
{% endanchor %}

If the campaign you are duplicating has either the label _Code Editor_ or _Design Editor_, then your duplicate will be opened in the indicated editor.
