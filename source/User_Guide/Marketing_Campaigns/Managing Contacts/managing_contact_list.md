Managing contacts is an integral part of your marketing campaigns lifecycle. You can create lists for contacts, as well as view and edit each individual contact within your contact database

  {% anchor h3 %}
Viewing a Contact
{% endanchor %}

To view a specific contact profile, find the contact in one of your lists or segments by searching your contact database. Then click the contact’s email address. You will then be able to view the email, engagement data, profile information, custom fields, and list associations for this contact.

{% info %}
Searches are case agnostic but must be done using a whole email address that includes an "@" and any top-level domain like ".com" or ".io".
{% endinfo %}

To view any custom fields you have assigned to this contact, or to view any lists that you have added this contact to, you may flip through the tabs beneath the Contact Details. You may either view all custom fields at once, or you can filter them by the following types: “Text”, “Date”, and “Number”.


{% anchor h3 %}
Editing a Contact
{% endanchor %}

When you are viewing a contact, click any of the Edit buttons to edit the contact's information within that section. This includes the SendGrid provided reserved fields, except email, any custom fields you’ve added for this contact, and any lists the contact is associated with.

*To edit the associated lists for your contact:*

1. Select the **Associated Lists** tab.
1. Enter or select the list you would like to use.
1. Click **Add**.

{% anchor h3 %}
Delete a Specific Contact
{% endanchor %}

*To remove one or more contacts from a list:*

1. Navigate to the contact you wish to modify and click the Action Menu.
1. Click **Remove From List**.
   This option removes the contact from the list. To remove the contact completely, select **delete**.

{% anchor h3 %}
Delete All Contacts
{% endanchor %}

*To delete all of your contacts at once:*

 1. Navigate to your [Contacts page](https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/contacts) and hover over the Action Menu next to All Contacts.
 1. Click the trash can icon.
 1. Select the check box to confirm that you want to delete all contacts and then click **Delete**.
