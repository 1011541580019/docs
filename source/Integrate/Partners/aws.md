SendGrid has partnered with Amazon to offer our email services on the Amazon Marketplace. Built for developers and designed for marketers, SendGrid offers developers simple SMTP and Web API integrations while non-technical users can leverage an intuitive interface to create, send, and analyze marketing emails. 

Once you have an AWS account, you can to subscribe to SendGrid and access it directly from the AWS Management Console. You have access to the SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Application, and the APIs. However use the AWS Management Console if you want to reset your password, cancel your account, or manage billing.
