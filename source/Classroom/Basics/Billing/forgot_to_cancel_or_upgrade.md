If you have not used your account in the current calendar month, we may be able to issue a refund or partial refund if you forgot to downgrade or cancel your account in the prior month. For more information on refund eligibility, [click here.]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Billing/i_would_like_to_request_a_refund.html) 

Refunds for forgotten cancellation/downgrade are only applicable to the subscription charge on your account, not for overages or contact storage charges accrued during the prior month. 

EXAMPLE:

If you request a refund on your $79.95/mo Pro account, and your monthly invoice totals $117.00 due to a combination of overages and contact storage, you are only eligible for a refund of up to 79.95. The remaining 37.05 cannot be refunded in this scenario.
