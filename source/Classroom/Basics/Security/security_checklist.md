SendGrid doesn’t compromise when it comes to compromised accounts and neither should you. Every day that you put off security steps, your reputation as a business and a sender is at risk. Use these suggestions to improve the security of your system.

How to keep your system secure.

{% anchor h3 %} 1) Use a robust password! {% endanchor %}

Password Do’s
- Use upper and lower case letters, numerals, and special characters.
- Set up Teammates to create, manage, and restrict additional sets of credentials to more precisely grant permissions within your SendGrid account.

Password Dont’s
- Don’t use the same password for multiple sites. Vary your passwords whenever possible.
- Don’t use easily guessable words or phrases such as personal information, your company name, or abbreviations.
- Don’t expose your password on public repositories like Github, in the notes in the HTML on web pages, or on social media.

{% anchor h3 %} 2) Don’t let web browsers automatically save your SendGrid password. {% endanchor %}

{% anchor h3 %} 3) Perform regular virus scans on any computers that are used to send mail through SendGrid or are used login to your account. {% endanchor %}

{% anchor h3 %} 4) Encrypt and secure wireless connections. {% endanchor %}

{% anchor h3 %} 5) Check for vulnerabilities in your web applications, and always make sure they are completely up to date. {% endanchor %}

- Often times, software updates fix vulnerabilities. For example, old versions of WordPress are vulnerable to exploitation. Review the [Harden WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress) documentation that will introduce you to basic security concepts and serve as a guide to making your WordPress website more secure.

{% anchor h3 %} 6) If you have a service that is sending emails through SendGrid, be sure there are checks in place to prevent visitors (or bots) from sending unwanted email in large volumes. {% endanchor %} 

- If you have an email registration form, [here are some helpful tips]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Security/keeping_your_registration_form_secure.html) to keep your form secure.

{% warning %}
SendGrid will never send you an email asking you to provide you account password, API keys, or Credit/Debit Card information. Please report any account phishing attempts to abuse@sendgrid.com.
