What is List-Unsubscribe?
{% endanchor %}

[List-Unsubscribe](http://www.list-unsubscribe.com/) is a small piece of text that can be inserted in the header section of your email. The List-Unsubscribe header will insert an "unsubscribe" button, or link, in your email making it easier for your recipients to unsubscribe from your mailing list.
