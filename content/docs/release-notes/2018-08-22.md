###	SendGrid Knowledge Center

Here at SendGrid we take our customers needs seriously, prioritizing ways we can help solve your problems. With that in mind, we're proud to present the new SendGrid [Knowledge Center]({{root_url}}/index/)! With our new Knowledge Center, we’re hoping you can find information on the SendGrid UI, APIs, and webhooks faster and easier.

The Knowledge Center streamlines your information-gathering process with precise search, concise how-to content, and straightforward shortcuts. Organized by task, with table of contents, “before you begin” sections, breadcrumbs, and interlinked related resources, we want you to find exactly what you need to know to complete your task quickly.
