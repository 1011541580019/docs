## Create an Automation


### Upload contacts

*To add new contacts:*

1. Click **Add Contacts** and then select **Upload CSV**.
2. Choose an existing list or create a new list.

<call-out>

If you choose to add the contacts without assigning them to a list, they exist in the contacts database without any additional context.
</call-out>

3. Upload your file by dragging it into or clicking the CSV upload area.

### Edit an Automation
Edit send time

### Disable an Automation
It’s like a pause button, but don’t say ‘pause’.
When a user re-enables the automation, the recipients included in the original automation will continue where they left off. Contacts added during the disabled period will not be included in the flow, so add warning/note for Olivia to not add any contacts while an automation is disabled.
