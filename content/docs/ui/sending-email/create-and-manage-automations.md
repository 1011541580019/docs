Introduction
Includes a brief intro of what automation is and how it can benefit them. (Doesn’t actually include the headline “introduction”. )
## Create an Automation


### Upload contacts

### Create a Welcome Series

### Create a Custom Automation

### Duplicate an Automation

## Manage Automations

### Edit an Automation
Edit send time
Edit message/campaign
Edit the entry criteria

### Disable an Automation
It’s like a pause button, but don’t say ‘pause’.
When a user re-enables the automation, the recipients included in the original automation will continue where they left off. Contacts added during the disabled period will not be included in the flow, so add warning/note for Olivia to not add any contacts while an automation is disabled.
### Delete an Automation

### Migrate Campaigns from Marketing Campaigns to Automations
Download HTML from MC
Paste HTML into the code editor for Automations.

## Reading Automation Data
