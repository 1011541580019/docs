If you already know your password, you can change your SendGrid password by editing your [Account Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/account) in the UI. If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it on the [Reset password page](https://app.sendgrid.com/forgot_password).

{% warning %}
When you change your account password, your SMTP and API access will change as well. Make sure you update your account information on all systems and software.
