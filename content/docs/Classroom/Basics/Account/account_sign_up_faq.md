When you sign up for a SendGrid account, there are a few steps that our users must complete before they can start using their accounts fully. You will have either one, two, or three separate steps to complete before you fully unlock the credit limits available to your chosen plan level. We require these steps for your security, as well as to help you get started more quickly!


<page-anchor el="h3">How long does the verification process take?</page-anchor>

The time it takes to completely unlock your account can vary based on the number of steps you are required to complete. The faster you complete the steps, the faster you can start sending!

<page-anchor el="h3">What steps are required?</page-anchor>

You will either have to verify your email address, set up two-factor authentication, and/or create a domain whitelabel. You may need to complete one or more of these steps to completely verify your account.

<page-anchor el="h3">Can I send email right away?</page-anchor>

Yes, you can send up to 100 emails per day even when your account is in a pre-verified state.

<page-anchor el="h3">Can I skip a verification step?</page-anchor>

Unfortunately you cannot skip a verification step, we require our users to complete the verification steps before their accounts are completely unlocked.

<page-anchor el="h3">Why do I only have 100 credits a day?</page-anchor>

You have either not yet completed the verification steps for your account, or your 30 day trial period has expired. Either complete the verification steps, or [upgrade your account](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) to send more email.

<page-anchor el="h3">Why don't I have all the credits available on my paid plan?</page-anchor>

Until you complete the required verification steps, you will only be able to send up to 100 emails per day. Once you complete the steps presented, your credit usage limits will be unlocked

<page-anchor el="h3">How do I resend the verification email?</page-anchor>

You can resend the verification to the email address you specified during the initial signup form by heading to the [verification guide](https://app.sendgrid.com/guide) and clicking "Resend in the "Confirm your Email Address" step.

<page-anchor el="h3">What if I entered my email address incorrectly?</page-anchor>

If you entered your email address incorrectly in the initial signup form, you can correct the email address and resend the verification email to the correct address.

<page-anchor el="h3">How do I set up two factor authentication?</page-anchor>

Learn more about setting up and using two factor authentication [here]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/two_factor_authentication.html).

<page-anchor el="h3">How do I set up the domain whitelabel?</page-anchor>

Learn about the benefits, and the process of setting up a domain whitelabel [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Whitelabel/setup_domain_whitelabel.html).

<page-anchor el="h3">Was my credit card charged even though I only have 100 credits per day?</page-anchor>

Yes. If you chose a paid plan during the initial signup form, your credit card is charged and your trial period begins right away. Complete the verification steps presented to you to unlock the full abilities of your paid account.

<page-anchor el="h3">When does the trial period begin?</page-anchor>

Your 30 day trial starts as soon as you complete the initial sign up form. Not when you complete the final verification step.

<page-anchor el="h3">What happens after my 30 day free trial?</page-anchor>

After your 30 day trial period expires you will maintain the same level of account functionality, and your settings will remain intact. However, you will only be able to send up to 100 emails per day from that point onwards, unless you choose to [upgrade your account](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing).
